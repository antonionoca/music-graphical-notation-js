# Music graphical notation project

Graphical representation of an mp3 song using Perlin noise and Three.js


The main goal of this project is to learn about music visualization,
web audio API and unit testing in JavaScript.   

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- NPM
- Place your mp3 file on the mp3 folder and rename it on main.js:9

## Installing

```
npm install
```

## Getting Started

```
npm start
```

This will initialize the application on http://localhost:9966

Open your browser and you'll view the graphical representation of your mp3.
Just like those good old Winamp visualizations.

## Technologies

- KarmaJS
- Three.js
- Browserify
- Web Audio API

## Running the tests

```
npm test
```

#TODO

IN PROGRESS - refactor code (classes)
- pure functions
- create new modules
- why 22 lines/channels
- why perlin noise
- profiling
